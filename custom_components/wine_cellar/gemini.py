- "type" must be exactly one of: "red", "white", "rosé", "sparkling", "dessert"
- For "type", infer from visual cues (bottle color, label text like "Blanc", "Rosé", "Brut") if not explicitly stated
- "barcode": if a barcode is visible in any image, read the digits printed alongside/below it (typically 8-14 digits, EAN-13 or UPC-A) and return them as a string. Only return digits you can actually read — null if no barcode is visible or the digits aren't legible.

- "drink_by": the LAST year of the drinking window
- "drink_window": optimal drinking window as "YYYY-YYYY" range
- Aging guidelines — be conservative:
  - Everyday reds/whites (under $20): 1-3 years from vintage = "Drink Now"
  - Quality reds ($20-50): 3-7 years from vintage
  - Premium Bordeaux, Barolo, Napa Cab ($50+): 10-15 years, rarely more than 20
  - Rosé: 1-2 years = always "Drink Now"
  - Most whites: 1-3 years. Quality Chardonnay/Riesling: 3-5 years

- For ambiguous types, infer from grape variety or region
- If the image contains no wines at all, return {{"error": "not_a_wine_list"}}

- "drink_by": the LAST year of the drinking window — when the wine should be consumed by. Be conservative and realistic.
- "drink_window": optimal drinking window as "YYYY-YYYY" range. This is what will be shown to the user.
- IMPORTANT aging guidelines — be conservative, most wines don't age long:
  - Most everyday reds and whites (under $20): drink within 1-3 years of vintage. These are "Drink Now."
  - Quality reds (good Cabernet, Merlot, Syrah, $20-50): 3-7 years from vintage
  - Premium Bordeaux, Barolo, Napa Cab ($50+): can age 10-15 years, rarely more than 20
  - Rosé: drink within 1-2 years of vintage — always "Drink Now"
  - Most whites (Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio): 1-3 years from vintage
  - Quality Chardonnay/Riesling: 3-5 years from vintage
  - Sparkling/Champagne NV: drink within 2-3 years. Vintage Champagne: 5-10 years.
  - Dessert wines (Sauternes, Port): can age 10-20+ years
  - NV (non-vintage) wines: assume current, "Drink Now" with drink_window "{current_year}-{current_year + 1}"
  - If the wine is already past its typical aging window, mark as "Past Peak" or "Drink Now" (not "Hold")
  - When in doubt, err on the side of drinking sooner rather than later
- "description": Write a professional tasting-style description of what this wine is known for. If you know the wine, describe its character. If not, describe what to expect based on grape, region, and vintage.
- Rating fields: If you know published critic scores for this specific wine and vintage, use those. Otherwise, provide your best estimated score (integer 85-100) based on the producer's track record, region quality, and vintage reputation. Only use null for obscure wines you truly cannot assess.
  - "rating_ws": Wine Spectator score (out of 100)
  - "rating_rp": Robert Parker / Wine Advocate score (out of 100)
  - "rating_jd": Jeb Dunnuck score (out of 100)
  - "rating_ag": Antonio Galloni / Vinous score (out of 100)
- "estimated_price": estimated current retail price in {currency} as a number (e.g. 45.00). Use your knowledge of the wine market to estimate what this bottle currently sells for. Return null only if you truly cannot estimate.
- "region"/"country"/"grape_variety"/"alcohol": only fill these in if the "Region"/"Country"/"Grape" fields above are empty AND you can actually determine them (from the label photo if attached, or from your own knowledge of this producer).
